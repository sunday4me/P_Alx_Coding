What gcc option is used for the first three stages?

The option to get the output of the assembly stage (including preprocessing, and compilation) is -c.

This means that if you want to do all the first three stages of the compilation, then you have to run the command below;

gcc -c name_of_source_file

where name_of_source_file is the name of the file containing your source code.

You may provide the name you want to give the output file as an attribute to the gcc command with the help of the option -o. That will look like;

gcc -c name_of_source_file -o name_of_output_file

The gcc -c command gives you an output file with the .o extension. Also, if you don't provide the name of the final output file, then it automatically uses 
the same name as the source code file.
